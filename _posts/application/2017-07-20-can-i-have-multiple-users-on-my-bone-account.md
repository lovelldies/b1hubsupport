title: Can I have multiple users on my B.One account?

Yes. You can give access to your devices/rooms/actions/security to other users (family members and guests). As the master account user, you can add, edit, or remove their privileges at any time. With the exception of adding and deleting the devices and Hub, the guest user can perform all the actions that the App supports.

Note: Guest users can't access Amazon Echo from Hub.
