title: How to configure Actions?
---

Go to **My Actions** in the dashboard or **Actions** in the bottom menu to configure an Action. 'Action' automates your routines which could be date/time triggered or sensor triggered (motion sensor or door sensor etc;) or location triggered. You can add up to 5 devices to each Action. A maximum of five devices can be added to a single trigger.

Let's say you want to leave to work in the morning, select **Departing location** as a trigger for your Action. You may want to switch the lights off, TV off and secure your home before you leave.

Pick your devices for the Action. Let's consider an IR device. The key which is to be automated can be customised. When the trigger is activated, the selected key is operated without user's presence.

**Note:** ZigBee and BLE devices cannot be a part of Actions.
