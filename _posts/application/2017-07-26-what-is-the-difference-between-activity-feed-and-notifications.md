title: What is the difference between Activity Feed and Notifications ?
---

**Activity Feed** provides a running list of activities from all the connected devices in your home. You can also see the time at which the devices are added or deleted from the Hub.

**Notifications** provides a summary of the actions B.One Hub has performed at your request, as well as alerts you've asked to receive.
