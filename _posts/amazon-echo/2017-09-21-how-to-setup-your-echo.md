title: How to setup your Echo?
---

Download the Alexa app from Google Play/Apple App Store and sign in.

- Plug the included power adapter into Echo and then into a power outlet. The light ring on Echo turns blue, and then orange. When the light turns orange, Echo greets you.

- Follow the guided instructions in the app to connect Echo to a Wi-Fi network. To learn more, go to [Connect Echo to Wi-Fi](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201549640).

- Tip: If your Echo doesn&#39;t connect to your Wi-Fi network, unplug and then plug the device into a power outlet to restart it. If you still have trouble, reset your Echo to its factory settings and set
it up again. To learn more, go to [Reset Your Amazon Echo or Echo Dot (1st Generation)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201819000).

- You can now use your Echo device. To get started, say the &quot;wake word&quot; and then speak naturally to Alexa. Your Echo device is set to respond to the wake word &quot;Alexa&quot; by default, but you can use the Alexa app to change the wake word at any time. In the app, go to [Settings](https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings), select your Echo device, and then select Wake word.
