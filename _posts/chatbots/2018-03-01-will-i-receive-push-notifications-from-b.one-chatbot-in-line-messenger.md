title: Will I receive Push notifications from B.One ChatBot in Line messenger?
---

Yes, you will receive push notifications when the sensor triggers an action. Push notifications enabled in the B.One app are also shown as live feed in the ChatBot.

**Example:**

* When a motion triggers (Motion and Multi Sensors).
* When the door is opened /closed (Door/Window Sensors).
* When the switch is turned ON/OFF.
