title: Do I receive Push notifications from B.One Bot?
---

Yes, you will receive push notifications when the sensors trigger an action. Push notifications enabled in the B.One app are also shown as live feed in the ChatBot.

**Example:**
- When a motion triggers (Motion and Multi Sensors).
- When the door is opened /closed (Door/Window Sensors).
