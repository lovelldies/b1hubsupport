1. Check if the Z Wave/ZigBee device is connected to another network.

2. Go to the **Settings** in the B.One Application and use the option "**Delete a Z Wave device**". Refer the product manual and follow the delete procedure and delete your device.

3. Make sure your Hub is in your line of sight.

4. If these options do not work, restart the B.One Hub and repeat the process.
