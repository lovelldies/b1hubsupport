title: Do I have any panic button in my B.One App?
---

Yes. Press and hold the B.One logo on the dashboard, which functions as a panic button. When the panic button is activated, the Sirens are switched ON, only if they are set to turn **ON** while the device is in Arm mode. Sirens can also be set to turn**ON** in In-house mode.

How to set the Sirens:

1. Tap on **My Devices.**

2. If you have already added Sirens to the Hub, just tap on the device. Else, add Sirens to your hub in order to proceed further.

3. The modes in which siren gets activated can be set by modifying the toggle switch present at the bottom of the screen.
