title: What happens in the event of Internet connection and/or power outage?
---

In the event of Internet outage, B.One's "Cloud Second" architecture enables the user to access and operate all devices as long as the user is in the Home network and the Wifi router is powered "ON". In the event the user is not in the Home network, he will not be able to access the B.One Hub and devices.

In the event of power outage, the built-in battery of B.One Hub will be active up-to 24 hours and will be able to send text notifications, If the SIM card is inserted, of any intrusions. Once the Internet and power are restored, the Hub and compatible devices will reconnect automatically.
