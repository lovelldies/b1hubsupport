title: Assign your devices to Rooms 
---

By assigning your devices to a room with Google Home Control, you can control multiple devices as a group. First, add rooms in Google Home Control and then assign devices to your rooms. 

**Note:** Rooms set up in Google Home Control are completely separate from the Rooms in the B.One app. The Google Assistant will not recognize the rooms in B.One. Also, Actions cannot be enabled through a command for a Room, so we do not recommend adding Actions to Rooms.
