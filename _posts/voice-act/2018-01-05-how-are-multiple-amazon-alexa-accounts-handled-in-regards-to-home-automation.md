title: How are multiple Amazon Alexa accounts handled in regards to Home Automation?
---

Amazon Alexa allows you to switch between users. You will only be able to control what is connected to the active user account. If you have a B.One device connected to Alexa Account #1 and music services connected to Alexa Account #2, you will not be able to both listen to music and control your devices. In this case, the account would need to be changed by just saying *‘Alexa, switch accounts’* to adjust the music or control a connected device.
