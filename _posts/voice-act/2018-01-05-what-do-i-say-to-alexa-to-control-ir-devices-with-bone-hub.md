title: What do I say to Alexa to control IR devices with B.One Hub?
---

Just say: *“Alexa, Turn ON TV”* or *“Alexa, Turn OFF TV”* to control IR devices with B.One Hub. 

**Note:** Please make sure to give each device a unique name in the B.One app so Alexa knows which devices you want to control. If you change the name of a device in the B.One app, you'll need to ask Alexa to discover devices to learn the new name of that device.
