title: Why won't Amazon Alexa discover my devices as soon as it's installed?

After your Wink account and Amazon accounts are linked, just say ‘Alexa, discover devices’. You can also discover devices in the ‘Connected Home’ section of the Alexa App Settings page. Select ‘Discover Devices’ to have Alexa find all connected and compatible devices.
