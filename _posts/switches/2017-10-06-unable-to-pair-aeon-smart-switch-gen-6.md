title: Unable to pair Aeon Smart Switch Gen 6

**Reset your Smart Switch Gen 6**

If at some stage, your primary controller is missing  or inoperable, you may wish to reset all of your Smart Switch 6 settings to their factory defaults and allow you to pair it to a new gateway. To do this:

1. Press and hold the Action Button for 20 seconds
2. The LED will change between these colors:
    - Yellow
    - Purple
    - Red (blinks faster and faster)
    - Green (Successful indication of factory reset)
    - Rainbow LED (waiting to pair to new network)
3. When the LED changes to Green state, you may let go of the action button.
4. When the LED changes to a rainbow LED state, it will indicate that it is ready to pair to a new network.

Ensure that the Smart switch 6 is within 3 - 4 meters from the Hub while you pair for better results.

This should resolve the issue.
